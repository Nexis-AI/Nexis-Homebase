# Nexis Dashboard Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Firebase Client Configuration
- Fixed conflicting options in Firestore settings by removing `experimentalForceLongPolling` since it cannot be used together with `experimentalAutoDetectLongPolling`.
- Added clearer documentation to the Firestore settings for better maintainability.

### 2. Wallet Configuration
- Updated the RPC transport configuration in `lib/wallet-config.ts` to be compatible with viem 2.23.5.
- Simplified the fallback configuration to use only the supported options.
- Improved the structure and readability of the transport creation.

### 3. Firebase Helper Types
- Updated the `setWalletCache` function in `lib/firebase/helpers.ts` to match the current `WalletCache` interface structure.
- Fixed the type compatibility to ensure proper handling of cache data.

## Additional Improvements
- Added proper documentation to configuration options.
- Simplified complex code to improve maintainability.
- Ensured production-ready error handling.

These fixes resolve the errors in the log file and ensure the application can run smoothly in both development and production environments.
