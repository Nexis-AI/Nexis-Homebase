# WalletConnect Disconnect Issue - Solution

## Problem Overview

The application was encountering the following error when attempting to disconnect a WalletConnect session:

```
Unhandled Runtime Error
TypeError: this.provider.disconnect is not a function

Call Stack
si.transportDisconnect
node_modules/@walletconnect/core/dist/index.es.js (1:42503)
eval
node_modules/@walletconnect/core/dist/index.es.js (1:46877)
eval
node_modules/@walletconnect/utils/dist/index.es.js (17:1407)
```

This error occurs because:

1. There's a version mismatch between WalletConnect v1 and v2 components
2. The code is attempting to call a `disconnect()` method on a provider that doesn't have such method
3. Different versions of WalletConnect handle disconnection differently

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented a solution that gracefully handles disconnection for both WalletConnect v1 and v2:

1. Created a `wallet-disconnect-patch.ts` utility that:
   - Tries multiple disconnection methods that might exist on the provider
   - Gracefully falls back to localStorage cleanup if no disconnect method is available
   - Properly handles errors during disconnection

2. Updated the `use-wallet-auth.ts` hook to:
   - Use our safe disconnect utility when disconnecting WalletConnect sessions
   - Ensure proper cleanup of resources

## How to Use

When disconnecting a WalletConnect provider, use the `safeDisconnectWalletConnect` utility:

```typescript
import { safeDisconnectWalletConnect } from '../wallet-disconnect-patch';

// When disconnecting:
safeDisconnectWalletConnect(walletConnectProvider);
```

## Future Improvements

To further improve WalletConnect integration:

1. **Version Consistency**: Consider standardizing on WalletConnect v2 throughout the codebase
2. **Better Error Handling**: Add more comprehensive error handling for connection/disconnection flows
3. **Session Management**: Implement better session management to handle expired or invalid sessions
4. **Testing**: Add tests specifically for wallet connection/disconnection scenarios

## Technical Details

The patch handles the following scenarios:

- WalletConnect v2 providers that have a `disconnect()` method
- WalletConnect v1 providers that might have `close()` or alternative methods
- Nested providers where the disconnect method is on `provider.provider`
- Cases where no disconnection method exists, and we need to rely on localStorage cleanup

This patch ensures that users can reliably disconnect their wallets without encountering runtime errors.
